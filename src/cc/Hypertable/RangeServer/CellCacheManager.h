  /// Manages the cell cache of an access group.
  /// When an access group undergoes a compaction, the cell cache needs to be
  /// frozen (i.e. made immutable) before it is written out to a cell store
  /// file.  This class manages this process by maintaining two caches, an
  /// active cache  that receives inserts, and an immutable cache, created when
  /// the active cache is frozen in preparation for a compaction.  It provides
  /// member functions for freezing the active cache to the immutable cache,
  /// dropping the immutable cache when it is no longer needed, and merging the
  /// two caches back together if a compaction was aborted.
