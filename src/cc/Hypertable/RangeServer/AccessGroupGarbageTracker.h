  /// Tracks access group garbage and signals when collection is needed.
  /// This class is used to heuristically estimate how much garbage has
  /// accumulated in the access group and will signal when collection is needed.
  /// The <code>Hypertable.RangeServer.AccessGroup.GarbageThreshold.Percentage</code>
  /// property defines the percentage of accumulated garbage in the access group
  /// that should trigger garbage collection.  The algorithm will signal that
  /// garbage collection is needed under the following circumstances:
  ///   1. If any of the column families in the access group has a non-zero
  ///      MAX_VERSIONS or there exists any delete records, <b>and</b> enough
  ///      data (heuristically determined) has accumulated since the last
  ///      collection.
  ///   2. If any of the column families in the access group has a non-zero
  ///      TTL, <b>and</b> the amount of the expirable data from the cell stores
  ///      plus the in-memory data (cell cache) accumulated since the last
  ///      collection represents a percentage of the overall access group size
  ///      that is greater than or equal to the garbage threshold, <b>and</b>
  ///      enough time (heuristically determined) has elapsed since the last
  ///      collection.
  ///
  /// The following code illustrates how to use this class.  Priodically, the
  /// member function check_needed() should be called to check whether or not
  /// garbage collection may be needed, for example:
  /// <pre>
  /// if (garbage_tracker.check_needed(now))
  ///   schedule_compaction();
  /// </pre>
  /// Then in the compaction routine, the actual garbage should be measured
  /// before proceeding with the compaction, for example:
  /// <pre>
  /// if (garbage_tracker.check_needed(now)) {
  ///   measure_garbage(&total, &garbage);
  ///   garbage_tracker.adjust_targets(now, total, garbage);
  ///   if (!garbage_tracker.collection_needed(total, garbage))
  ///     abort_compaction();
  /// }
  /// </pre>
  /// The next step of the compaction routine is to perform the compaction:
  /// <pre>
  /// %MergeScannerAccessGroup *mscanner = new %MergeScannerAccessGroup ...
  /// while (scanner->get(key, value)) {
  ///   ...
  ///   scanner->forward();
  /// }
  /// </pre>
  /// At this point, the merge scanner should be passed into adjust_targets() to
  /// adjust the targets based on the statistics collected during the merge:
  /// <pre>
  /// garbage_tracker.adjust_targets(now, mscanner);
  /// </pre>
  /// Finally, in the compaction routine, after the call to adjust_targets(), it
  /// is safe to drop the immutable cache or merge it back into the regular
  /// cache as is the case with <i>in memory</i> compactions.  At the end of the
  /// compaction routine, once the set of cell stores has been updated, the
  /// update_cellstore_info() routine must be called to properly update the
  /// state of the garbage tracker.  For example:
  /// <pre>
  /// bool gc_compaction = (mscanner->get_flags() &
  ///                       MergeScannerAccessGroup::RETURN_DELETES) == 0;
  /// garbage_tracker.update_cellstore_info(stores, now, gc_compaction);
