  /** Base clase for application handlers.  Objects of this type are what get
   * added to an ApplicationQueue.  Provides a constructor for initialization
   * from request MESSAGE event received from the comm layer.
   * There are two attributes of a request handler that control how it is
   * treated in the Application queue:
   *
   * <b>Group ID</b>
   *
   * The ApplicationQueue supports serial execution of requests that operate on
   * a shared resource.  This is achieved through the application request
   * handler <i>group ID</i>.  Application request handlers that contain the
   * same group ID will get executed in series.  When initialized from a MESSAGE
   * event, the group ID is the same as the CommHeader#gid field of the message
   * header, otherwise it is 0.
   *
   * <b>Urgency</b>
   *
   * The ApplicationQueue supports two-level request prioritization.  Requests
   * can be designated as <i>urgent</i> which will cause them to be executed
   * before other non-urgent requests.  Urgent requests will also be executed
   * even when the ApplicationQueue has been paused.  When initialized from a
   * MESSAGE Event, the #m_urgent field will get set to <i>true</i> if the
   * CommHeader::FLAGS_BIT_URGENT is set in the CommHeader#flags field of the
   * message header.
