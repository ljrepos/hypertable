  /** Maps a set of proxy names to their associated IP addresses.
   * Hypertable uses <i>proxy names</i> (e.g. "rs1") to refer to servers so
   * that the system can continue to operate properly even when servers are
   * reassigned IP addresses, such as starting and stopping Hypertable running
   * on EBS volumes in AWS EC2.  There is a single ProxyMap associated with
   * each Comm layer and one of the connected participants is designated as
   * the <i>proxy master</i> by setting the global variable
   * <code>ReactorFactory::proxy_master</code> to <i>true</i>.
   * In Hypertable, the Master is designated as the proxy master.  The proxy
   * master is responsible for assigning proxy names which are just mnemonic
   * strings (e.g. "rs1").  Whenever a server connects to the proxy master,
   * the proxy master will either assign the newly connected server a proxy
   * name or obtain it via a handshake and should then update the proxy map with
   * the <i>{proxy name, IP address}</i> association and will propagate the new
   * proxy map information to all connected participants.  Once this is
   * complete, all connected participants and send and receive messages to any
   * participant using its proxy name.  The CommAddress class is an abstraction
   * that can hold either a proxy name or an IP address and used to identify
   * the destination of a message.
